You can use any SvelteKit adapter that deploys to a target that supports a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime.

If you don't have a full-stack hosting solution you can provision a serverless PostgreSQL database provider using [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and host your frontend on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) starting at no cost.

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can also preview the build.

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

## Cleanup
